# Rmd Analysis scripts

This folder contains all analysis scripts for preprocessing, plotting and summarizing or analysing data from the original experiment, our pilot and our main replication experiment in the respective subfolders, which are organized and named like the following:
- 01_original
    - original_paper_analysis.Rmd
- 02_pilot
    - pilot_analysis.Rmd
    - power_analysis.Rmd
- 03_main
    - 01_data_analysis.Rmd
    - 02_power_analysis.Rmd
    - 03_optional_data_analysis.Rmd

*Note:* `03_main/03_optional_data_analysis.Rmd` contains code for generating additional plots and figures for visualization of socio-demographic data and additional information from the data we obtained in our study. The final versions of these plots are included in the final paper for our study (cf. `../writing/03_termPaper/termPaper.Rmd`).
