This folder contains code used for implementing the respective experiments with \_magpie, along with participant information, stimulus material and other files needed for running the experiment orgnaized in the following way:

* 01_original
    - stimulus_material
        + stimulus_small.jpg
        + stimulus_large.jpg
* 02_pilot
    - [everything about the pilot]
    - [stimulus_material]
    - [magpie-code]
    - [participant information]
    - link for online try-out version(?)
* 03_main
    - [see pilot]

*Grading criteria*:
   -  How difficult is the experiment to implement? [1-10]
   -  Is there a *link for an online try-out version*? [Y/N]
   -  How buggy is the experiment code? [1-10]
   -  How elegant is the experiment code? [1-10]
   -  Is the implementation a good realization of what is written in the 'experiment description'? [1-10]
   -  Are there additional technical nuggets, e.g., does the experiment go beyond the original experiment in reasonable and smart ways from a technical point of view? [1-10]
   -  Is the experimental material adequate for the intended replication purpose? [1-10]
   -  How difficult was the compilation of the experimental material? [1-10]
